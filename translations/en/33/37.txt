(37) And [remember, O Muḥammad], when you said to the one on whom Allāh bestowed favor and you bestowed favor,¹¹⁹⁸ "Keep your wife and fear Allāh," while you concealed within yourself that which Allāh is to disclose.¹¹⁹⁹ And you feared the people,¹²⁰⁰ while Allāh has more right that you fear Him.¹²⁰¹ So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort [i.e., guilt] concerning the wives of their claimed [i.e., adopted] sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command [i.e., decree] of Allāh accomplished.
