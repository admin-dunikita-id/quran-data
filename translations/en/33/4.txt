(4) Allāh has not made for a man two hearts in his interior. And He has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful¹¹⁸⁰ your mothers. And He has not made your claimed [i.e., adopted] sons your [true] sons. That is [merely] your saying by your mouths, but Allāh says the truth, and He guides to the [right] way.
