(10) And why do you not spend in the cause of All훮h while to All훮h belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth? Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquest [of Makkah] and fought [and those who did so after it]. Those are greater in degree than they who spent afterwards and fought. But to all All훮h has promised the best [reward]. And All훮h, of what you do, is Aware.
