(54) Indeed, your Lord is Allāh, who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne.³⁷⁸ He covers the night with the day, [another night] chasing it rapidly; and [He created] the sun, the moon, and the stars, subjected by His command. Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allāh, Lord of the worlds.
