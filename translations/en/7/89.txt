(89) We would have invented against All훮h a lie if we returned to your religion after All훮h had saved us from it. And it is not for us to return to it except that All훮h, our Lord, should will. Our Lord has encompassed all things in knowledge. Upon All훮h we have relied. Our Lord, decide between us and our people in truth, and You are the best of those who give decision."
