(187) They ask you, [O Muḥammad], about the Hour: when is its arrival?⁴²⁸ Say, "Its knowledge is only with my Lord. None will reveal its time except Him. It lays heavily⁴²⁹ upon the heavens and the earth. It will not come upon you except unexpectedly." They ask you as if you are familiar with it. Say, "Its knowledge is only with Allāh, but most of the people do not know."
