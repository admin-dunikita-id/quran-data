(189) It is He who created you from one soul and created from it its mate that he⁴³⁰ might dwell in security with her. And when he [i.e., man] covers her,⁴³¹ she carries a light burden [i.e., a pregnancy] and continues therein. And when it becomes heavy, they both invoke Allāh, their Lord, "If You should give us a good⁴³² [child], we will surely be among the grateful."
