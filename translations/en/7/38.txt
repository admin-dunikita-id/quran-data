(38) [Allāh] will say, "Enter among nations which had passed on before you of jinn and mankind into the Fire." Every time a nation enters, it will curse its sister³⁶⁹ until, when they have all overtaken one another therein, the last of them³⁷⁰ will say about the first of them,³⁷¹ "Our Lord, these had misled us, so give them a double punishment of the Fire." He will say, "For each is double, but you do not know."
