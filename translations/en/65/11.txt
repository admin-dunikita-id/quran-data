(11) [He sent] a Messenger [i.e., Muḥammad (ﷺ)] reciting to you the distinct verses of Allāh that He may bring out those who believe and do righteous deeds from darknesses into the light. And whoever believes in Allāh and does righteousness - He will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein forever. Allāh will have perfected for him a provision.
