(4) And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women - if you doubt, then their period is three months, and [also for] those who have not menstruated. And for those who are pregnant, their term is until they give birth.¹⁷⁰⁰ And whoever fears Allāh - He will make for him of his matter ease.
