(228) Divorced women remain in waiting [i.e., do not remarry] for three periods,⁸⁶ and it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allāh has created in their wombs if they believe in Allāh and the Last Day. And their husbands have more right to take them back in this [period] if they want reconciliation.⁸⁷ And due to them [i.e., the wives] is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable.⁸⁸ But the men [i.e., husbands] have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. And Allāh is Exalted in Might and Wise.
