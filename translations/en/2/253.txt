(253) Those messengers - some of them We caused to exceed others. Among them were those to whom All훮h spoke, and He raised some of them in degree. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs, and We supported him with the Pure Spirit [i.e., Gabriel]. If All훮h had willed, those [generations] succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, and some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if All훮h had willed, they would not have fought each other, but All훮h does what He intends.
