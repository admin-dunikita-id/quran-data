(247) And their prophet said to them, "Indeed, All훮h has sent to you Saul as a king." They said, "How can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?" He said, "Indeed, All훮h has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And All훮h gives His sovereignty to whom He wills. And All훮h is all-Encompassing [in favor] and Knowing."
