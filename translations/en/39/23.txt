(23) All훮h has sent down the best statement: a consistent Book wherein is reiteration. The skins shiver therefrom of those who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts relax at the remembrance [i.e., mention] of All훮h. That is the guidance of All훮h by which He guides whom He wills. And one whom All훮h sends astray - for him there is no guide.
