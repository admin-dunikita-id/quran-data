(26) When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts chauvinism - the chauvinism of the time of ignorance. But Allāh sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers and imposed upon them the word of righteousness, and they were more deserving of it and worthy of it. And ever is Allāh, of all things, Knowing.
