(97) Allāh has made the Kaʿbah, the Sacred House, standing²⁸⁶ for the people and [has sanctified] the sacred months and the sacrificial animals and the garlands [by which they are identified]. That is so you may know that Allāh knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and that Allāh is Knowing of all things.
