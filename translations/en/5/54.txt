(54) O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion - All훮h will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him [who are] humble toward the believers, strong against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of All훮h and do not fear the blame of a critic. That is the favor of All훮h; He bestows it upon whom He wills. And All훮h is all-Encompassing and Knowing.
