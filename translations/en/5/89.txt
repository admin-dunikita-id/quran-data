(89) Allāh will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless²⁷⁹ in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation²⁸⁰ is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths.²⁸¹ Thus does Allāh make clear to you His verses [i.e., revealed law] that you may be grateful.
