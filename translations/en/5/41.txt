(41) O Messenger, let them not grieve you who hasten into disbelief – of those who say, "We believe" with their mouths, but their hearts believe not, and from among the Jews. [They are] avid listeners to falsehood, listening to another people who have not come to you.²⁶⁴ They distort words beyond their [proper] places [i.e., usages], saying, "If you are given this,²⁶⁵ take it; but if you are not given it, then beware." But he for whom Allāh intends fitnah²⁶⁶ - never will you possess [power to do] for him a thing against Allāh. Those are the ones for whom Allāh does not intend to purify their hearts. For them in this world is disgrace, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.
