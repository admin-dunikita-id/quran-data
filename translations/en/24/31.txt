(31) And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision⁹⁹⁰ and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment⁹⁹¹ except that which [necessarily] appears thereof⁹⁹² and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment [i.e., beauty] except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess [i.e., slaves], or those male attendants having no physical desire,⁹⁹³ or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to Allāh in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.
