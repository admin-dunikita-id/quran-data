(78) And strive for All훮h with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. He [i.e., All훮h] named you "Muslims" before [in former scriptures] and in this [revelation] that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. So establish prayer and give zak훮h and hold fast to All훮h. He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper.
