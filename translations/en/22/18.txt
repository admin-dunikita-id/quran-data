(18) Do you not see [i.e., know] that to Allāh prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures and many of the people? But upon many the punishment has been justified.⁹²⁰ And he whom Allāh humiliates - for him there is no bestower of honor. Indeed, Allāh does what He wills.
