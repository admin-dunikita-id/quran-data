(11) O you who have believed, when you are told, "Space yourselves" in assemblies, then make space; Allāh will make space for you.¹⁶⁴⁵ And when you are told, "Arise,"¹⁶⁴⁶ then arise; Allāh will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees. And Allāh is Aware of what you do.
