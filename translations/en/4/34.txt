(34) Men are in charge of women¹⁸² by [right of] what Allāh has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allāh would have them guard.¹⁸³ But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance¹⁸⁴ - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them [lightly].¹⁸⁵ But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allāh is ever Exalted and Grand.
