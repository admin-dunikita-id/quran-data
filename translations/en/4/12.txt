(12) And for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child. But if they have a child, for you is one fourth of what they leave, after any bequest they [may have] made or debt. And for them [i.e., the wives] is one fourth if you leave no child. But if you leave a child, then for them is an eighth of what you leave, after any bequest you [may have] made or debt. And if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth. But if they are more than two, they share a third,¹⁶⁷ after any bequest which was made or debt, as long as there is no detriment [caused].¹⁶⁸ [This is] an ordinance from Allāh, and Allāh is Knowing and Forbearing.
