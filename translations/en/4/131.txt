(131) And to All훮h belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And We have instructed those who were given the Scripture before you and yourselves to fear All훮h. But if you disbelieve - then to All훮h belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And ever is All훮h Free of need and Praiseworthy.
