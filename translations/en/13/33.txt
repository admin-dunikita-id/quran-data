Or do you inform Him of that⁶⁴¹ which He knows not upon the earth or of what is apparent [i.e., alleged] of speech?"⁶⁴² Rather, their [own] plan has been made attractive to those who disbelieve, and they have been averted from the way. And whomever Allāh sends astray - there will be for him no guide.
