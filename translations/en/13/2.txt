(2) It is Allāh who erected the heavens without pillars that you [can] see; then He established Himself above the Throne⁶²³ and made subject⁶²⁴ the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term. He arranges [each] matter; He details the signs that you may, of the meeting with your Lord, be certain.
