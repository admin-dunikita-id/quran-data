(2) It is He who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture¹⁶⁵¹ from their homes at the first gathering.¹⁶⁵² You did not think they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allāh; but [the decree of] Allāh came upon them from where they had not expected, and He cast terror into their hearts [so] they destroyed their houses by their [own] hands and the hands of the believers. So take warning, O people of vision.
