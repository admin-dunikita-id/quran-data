(40) If you do not aid him [i.e., the Prophet (ﷺ)] - Allāh has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out [of Makkah] as one of two,⁴⁷⁶ when they were in the cave and he [i.e., Muḥammad (ﷺ)] said to his companion, "Do not grieve; indeed Allāh is with us." And Allāh sent down His tranquility upon him and supported him with soldiers [i.e., angels] you did not see and made the word⁴⁷⁷ of those who disbelieved the lowest,⁴⁷⁸ while the word of Allāh⁴⁷⁹ - that is the highest. And Allāh is Exalted in Might and Wise.
