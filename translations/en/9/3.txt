(3) And [it is] an announcement from Allāh and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage⁴⁶² that Allāh is disassociated from the disbelievers, and [so is] His Messenger. So if you repent, that is best for you; but if you turn away - then know that you will not cause failure to Allāh.⁴⁶³ And give tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment.
