(74) They swear by Allāh that they did not say [anything against the Prophet (ﷺ)] while they had said the word of disbelief and disbelieved after their [pretense of] Islām and planned that which they were not to attain.⁴⁹³ And they were not resentful except [for the fact] that Allāh and His Messenger had enriched them of His bounty.⁴⁹⁴ So if they repent, it is better for them; but if they turn away, Allāh will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And there will not be for them on earth any protector or helper.
