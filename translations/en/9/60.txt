(60) Zakāh expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed for it⁴⁸⁷ and for bringing hearts together [for Islām] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allāh and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allāh. And Allāh is Knowing and Wise.
