(179) All훮h would not leave the believers in that [state] you are in [presently] until He separates the evil from the good. Nor would All훮h reveal to you the unseen. But [instead], All훮h chooses of His messengers whom He wills, so believe in All훮h and His messengers. And if you believe and fear Him, then for you is a great reward.
