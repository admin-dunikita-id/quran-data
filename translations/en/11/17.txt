(17) So is one who [stands] upon a clear evidence from his Lord [like the aforementioned]? And a witness⁵⁵⁵ from Him follows it,⁵⁵⁶ and before it was the Scripture of Moses to lead and as mercy. Those [believers in the former revelations] believe in it [i.e., the Qur’ān]. But whoever disbelieves in it from the [various] factions - the Fire is his promised destination. So be not in doubt about it. Indeed, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of the people do not believe.
