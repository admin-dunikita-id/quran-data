[378]- There are several linguistic meanings of the words "istawā ʿalā," among them:  to settle upon, to assume ascendancy above, and to assert authority over.  However, it is known that all the attributes of Allāh are eternal, i.e., they have always existed and were present before He created.  Thus, it cannot be said that He "rose" above the Throne, as Allāh has always been ascendant.  Because the Creator may not be compared to His creation, the Prophet's companions and early scholars refused speculation as to how His actions could be interpreted, considering any such attempt unlawful.  Similarly, the true nature of the Throne is known only to Allāh, the Exalted.
