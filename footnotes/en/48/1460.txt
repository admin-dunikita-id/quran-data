[1507]- Ibn Masʿūd said, "You [people] consider the conquest to be that of Makkah, but we consider it to be the Treaty of al-Ḥudaybiyyah."  Al-Bukhārī reported a similar quotation from al-Barā’ bin ʿĀzib.  Although initially regarded by the companions as a setback, the treaty, in effect, served to promote the spread of Islām, which led to the conquest of Makkah two years later.
