[166]- Based upon prophetic ḥadīths, scholars have ruled that debt takes precedent over a bequest, that a bequest may not include any who inherit by law, and that the total bequest may not be more than one third of one's estate.  After the fulfillment of debts and bequests (if any), the remainder of the estate is to be divided according to the ordinances in this sūrah.
